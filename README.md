# Underway-Data-Processing
Processing and plotting underway data and comparing with CTD and sample data

After cloning the project, make a copy of the .REnviron_sample file and rename
it to .REnviron.

Modify the settings in the .REnviron for the specific cruise:
* set the directory TSG_Input_Directory path to where the TSG files are saved.
* set the Processed_Directory to where you wish the processed files to be written to, don't write them to the Underway-Data-Processing project directory.
* set the Cruise_Number for the mission, e.g "DY18402"
