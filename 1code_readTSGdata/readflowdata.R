#' @description Reads in flow output file from underway flow through system and 
#' writes one csv file per log file with the name FLOWdata_yyyymmdd.csv 
#' assuming the log file name is FLOW_yyyymmdd.CSV which is saved once per day
#' 
#' @param pathrawdata the folder name with the raw data to be read
#' @param pathprocesseddata the folder name of with the output processed data
#'  
#' @output a csv data file with date, time intake, TSG and PCO2 flow rates
